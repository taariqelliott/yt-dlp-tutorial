# Windows Installation and Setup for yt-dlp with Custom Function

## 1. Install Python and pip

**IMPORTANT: (IF YOU MESS UP A COMMAND AND NEED TO START ON A NEW LINE JUST PRESS `CTRL` + `C` or to clear the terminal type `cls` then enter)**

2. Run the following commands to install the latest Python:

First, we need to install Python (which includes pip):

1. Open PowerShell **as Administrator**

```powershell
winget search Python.Python
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

3. Verify the installation by opening a new PowerShell window and running:

```powershell
python --version
pip --version
```

You should see version numbers for both Python and pip (Python should be 3.12.x).

## 2. Install yt-dlp and ffmpeg using Winget

Now install yt-dlp and ffmpeg:

1. In the same PowerShell window (as Administrator), run:

```powershell
winget search yt-dlp
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp
winget search ffmpeg
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```

2. After installation completes, **close the PowerShell window**

## 3. Verify Installation of yt-dlp and ffmpeg

1. Open a new PowerShell window and run the following commands to verify the installations:

```powershell
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

You should see the version numbers printed in the terminal.

## 4. Create Custom Command in PowerShell Profile

1. Open your PowerShell profile by running this command:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

2. Add the following function to the bottom of the file:

```powershell
function downloadSample {
    param([string]$url)
    yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav --audio-quality 0 $url
}
```

**Note**: You can name the function whatever you like (e.g., `sampleDownload`, `audioDownload`), but ensure the casing matches when you use it.

3. **Save** the file and close Notepad

## 5. Restart PowerShell

1. Close the current PowerShell window
2. Open a **new PowerShell window** for the changes to take effect

## 6. Test Your Custom Command

1. Change to the directory where you want the file to be downloaded:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop
```

2. Run the following command to test your custom function:

```powershell
downloadSample https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3MNViBnMUA
```

The video should download as a WAV audio file in your specified directory.

## 7. Summary

- ✓ Installed Python 3.12 and pip
- ✓ Installed yt-dlp and ffmpeg using winget
- ✓ Created a custom command `downloadSample` in PowerShell with proper parameter handling
- ✓ Verified installations and tested the custom function

## Troubleshooting

If you receive a "command not found" error after installation:

1. Close and reopen PowerShell
2. If the error persists, check if Python is in your system's PATH by running:

```powershell
$env:Path -split ';'
```

3. You should see Python paths listed. If not, you may need to manually add Python to your system's PATH variables.
4. Make sure to check both of these paths are present:
   - `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\`
   - `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\`
